Exercise and Women's Health Dataset  

Regular physical activity influences hormonal balance in women. Moderate-intensity exercise helps regulate estrogen and progesterone levels, reducing the risk of conditions like PCOS and endometriosis. However, excessive high-intensity training can lead to irregular periods or even amenorrhea due to lowered estrogen levels. Strength training supports muscle mass retention, especially during menopause when estrogen declines.  

Pregnant women benefit from moderate exercise, such as walking, swimming, and prenatal yoga, which improve circulation, reduce back pain, and enhance mood. However, high-impact activities or exercises requiring prolonged lying on the back after the first trimester should be avoided. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) recommends at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise per week for pregnant women.  

After childbirth, women should focus on core and pelvic floor strengthening exercises, such as Kegels and deep abdominal breathing, to restore stability. Low-impact activities like walking and gentle yoga can be reintroduced before progressing to higher-intensity workouts. Women recovering from C-sections should avoid abdominal strain for at least 6-8 weeks.  

During menopause, women experience a decline in estrogen, which affects bone density, muscle mass, and metabolism. Weight-bearing exercises like walking, resistance training, and yoga help maintain bone density and prevent osteoporosis. High-intensity interval training (HIIT) and strength training can counteract weight gain associated with hormonal changes.  

Strength training is essential for women, as it improves bone density, enhances metabolism, and reduces the risk of sarcopenia (age-related muscle loss). Common myths include the fear of "bulking up," but due to lower testosterone levels, women naturally develop lean muscle. Recommended exercises include squats, deadlifts, and bodyweight movements like push-ups and planks.  

Heart disease is a leading cause of death among women, making cardiovascular exercise crucial. Activities such as running, cycling, and swimming improve heart function and circulation. The American Heart Association suggests at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity cardio per week or 75 minutes of vigorous-intensity exercise.  

Physical activity releases endorphins, reducing symptoms of anxiety and depression. Yoga and Pilates enhance relaxation and improve mindfulness, while aerobic exercise like dancing and cycling boost serotonin and dopamine levels. Women who engage in regular exercise report better sleep quality and stress management.  

Women are more prone to ACL (anterior cruciate ligament) injuries due to anatomical differences in knee structure. Strengthening the glutes and quadriceps and practicing proper landing techniques in sports can reduce injury risk. Overtraining can lead to stress fractures and burnout, making rest days and recovery crucial.  

The menstrual cycle affects energy levels, endurance, and recovery. During the follicular phase (Days 1-14), estrogen levels rise, making this a good time for strength training and high-intensity workouts. Around ovulation (Day 14), peak estrogen levels improve power and coordination, but the risk of ligament injuries is higher due to increased joint laxity. In the luteal phase (Days 15-28), progesterone rises, leading to increased fatigue and water retention, making lower-intensity workouts more suitable.  

Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) affects metabolism, insulin sensitivity, and hormone levels. Strength training helps with insulin resistance and muscle mass retention, while cardio improves heart health and supports weight management. Low-impact workouts like yoga and Pilates can help reduce cortisol levels and balance hormones. Women with PCOS should avoid excessive high-intensity workouts, which may elevate cortisol and worsen symptoms.  

Endometriosis causes chronic pelvic pain, but gentle movement can improve symptoms. The best exercises for women with endometriosis include low-impact activities like walking, swimming, and yoga. High-intensity workouts that may trigger inflammation or increase pain should be avoided. Stretching, core stability work, and deep breathing techniques help reduce discomfort and improve pelvic health.  

Women are at higher risk of osteoporosis due to lower bone density, especially post-menopause. Weight-bearing and resistance exercises such as walking, resistance training, yoga, and Pilates help maintain bone strength. High-impact activities should be avoided if diagnosed with osteoporosis, as they increase fracture risk. Adequate calcium, vitamin D, and strength training help support bone health.  

Women undergoing or recovering from breast cancer treatment benefit from tailored exercise programs. Strength training helps rebuild muscle lost during treatment. Yoga and stretching reduce stiffness and improve mobility, especially after surgery. Cardiovascular exercise enhances energy levels and supports immune function. Exercise helps reduce fatigue and improves overall well-being in cancer survivors.  

Strength training during pregnancy supports posture and reduces back pain. Safe exercises include squats, lunges, resistance band exercises, and bodyweight movements. Heavy overhead lifting, excessive abdominal pressure, and lying flat on the back after the first trimester should be avoided. Kegel exercises strengthen the pelvic floor, preventing incontinence and supporting postpartum recovery.  

After childbirth, core recovery is crucial, especially for women with diastasis recti (ab separation). The best exercises for postpartum recovery include deep breathing, pelvic tilts, bird dogs, and glute bridges. Crunches and planks should be avoided until core stability is regained. Gradual core reactivation helps restore strength and prevent long-term weakness.  

Hypothyroidism can cause fatigue and weight gain, while hyperthyroidism may lead to muscle loss. For hypothyroidism, strength training helps boost metabolism, while low-intensity cardio supports energy levels. Women with hyperthyroidism should focus on resistance training to prevent muscle loss and avoid excessive endurance exercise. Balancing exercise with proper thyroid medication and nutrition is key.  

High-Intensity Interval Training (HIIT) is effective for fat loss and cardiovascular health but should be balanced with recovery. HIIT burns fat, improves heart health, and boosts metabolism, but excessive HIIT may increase cortisol and lead to hormonal imbalances. Women should avoid daily HIIT and incorporate rest or lower-intensity workouts.  

Yoga supports flexibility, stress reduction, and hormonal balance. Restorative yoga helps with PMS, menopause, and stress. Power yoga and vinyasa styles build strength and cardiovascular endurance. Prenatal yoga supports pregnancy and prepares for childbirth. Breathwork (pranayama) in yoga helps regulate cortisol and supports emotional well-being.  

Women often experience sleep disturbances due to hormonal changes. Regular exercise improves sleep quality. Morning workouts help regulate circadian rhythms, while evening workouts should avoid high-intensity activity before bed. Yoga and stretching can be beneficial for relaxation and deep sleep. Overtraining and excessive cardio can elevate cortisol, disrupting sleep patterns.  

The pelvic floor supports bladder control and core stability. Weakness can cause issues like incontinence, while excessive tension may lead to pain. Strengthening exercises include Kegels, bridges, and deep squats, while relaxation exercises include hip stretches and diaphragmatic breathing. Impact activities like running may worsen pelvic floor dysfunction if the muscles are weak.  

Women are more likely to develop autoimmune diseases, requiring specialized exercise plans. For lupus, low-impact activities like swimming and yoga prevent joint stress. Rheumatoid arthritis patients benefit from strength training and mobility work. Multiple sclerosis patients should focus on balance exercises, resistance training, and gentle stretching to improve mobility. Listening to the body and prioritizing rest is crucial for managing symptoms.  

Physical activity influences gut microbiota and digestion. Moderate exercise supports healthy gut bacteria and improves digestion, while high-intensity workouts may increase gut permeability ("leaky gut") in some women. Hydration and proper nutrition are essential for gut health during exercise.  

Womenâ€™s hydration needs vary based on activity level, climate, and menstrual cycle. Before exercise, it's recommended to drink 16-20 oz of water. During exercise, 7-10 oz every 10-20 minutes helps maintain hydration. After exercise, consuming 24 oz per pound lost through sweat is important. Electrolyte replenishment is essential after intense workouts or in hot weather.
